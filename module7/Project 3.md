# Project 3: Calculators, Tests, and getOpt

In this program, you'll be required to make a calculator. This calculator ought to have the options: 

- `-t`: Test:  which runs all tests. 
- `-h`: Help: a command which displays a help message on how to run the program

Your calculator ought to prompt the user as to whether they would like to **add**, **multiply**, **divide**, **subtract**, and get the **remainder (modulus)** any two numbers provided by the user. The menu provided to the user ought to ensure that the user has given a meaningful input (that is, that they're not entering wrong numbers) as well. Additionally, each action must be its own function AND have tests testing each function. Your tests and helper functions need to be in a separate file!

Your program will also be required to have a `makefile` for compiling. 



### Turning in your program: 

Upon submission, please ensure that your program can compile and run on delmar before submitting. 

Please submit your `*.c` , and `*.h` header files, and your `makefile` to canvas in a zip file.
